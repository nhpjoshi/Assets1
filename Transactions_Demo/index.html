      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

Sakshi is one of the key resource we have in the system , She does things proactively able to handle relationship with customer really well , I am working with her only on darwinbox which is India's largest account , She is able to communicate like a leader with all the clarity , she is able to own the deliverables.  For example she herself has taken the initiative schedule cadence meetings and make sure she can capture all the details , She is great team player and understand to whom to reach in case of any difficult situations in the accounts.




1. I think she has very good skill of maintaining relationship , being part of tech company , I believe she should go into the depth of technology which can make her very confident and independent in the ecosystem and eventually she can lead it the teams very well.

Rest,  she is good , I am happy and always looking forward to work with her.
